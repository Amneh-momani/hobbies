In this website there's many questions for users and they have to asnwer all of them .

so first thing it asks about the user (name,age) then it shows welcome msg for that user then it completes asking the questions about(his fav color, first city he would like to visit , the 2nd city then it will multiply 2 numbers the user will input them then ,ask him which hobby does he want to know, ask about his fav hobby and if it wasn't available then it will show him the options to choose one of them,ask how much time he prefer to does this hobby ).

After that it will show the results as paragraphs in separate places with little expressions and the rate of his hobby as a pic and if he chose unavailable hobby that he would to know more about it then it will show red paragraph of that issue.

there's an introduction of the website then a section of few hobbies with short description for each one of them with their pics.
